Transcoding services for ANY WordPress website. Convert audio/video files of any format to a web-friendly format (mp3/mp4).

== Description ==
Transcoder easily converts all audio and video files uploaded to your website to a web-friendly format.

Transcoder eliminates the need for a dedicated media node- no fiddling with installation, managing dependancies or renting servers! Transcoder also works on shared hosting- just install, subscribe and go!

All transcoding services are available via a subscription plan through this plugin.
Subscribe to our free plan from the plugin's settings or from our [product page](https://rtmedia.io/transcoder/?utm_source=readme&utm_medium=plugin&utm_campaign=transcoder). Note that Transcoder will not provide any services without a subscription plan.

* Audio: mp3, m4a, wav, ogg, wma
* Video: 3g2, 3gp, avi, flv, m4v, mp4, mpg, ogv, webm, wmv

Create the ultimate niche community by combining Transcoder with our [rtMedia](https://wordpress.org/plugins/buddypress-media/) plugin. Transcoder works perfectly with rtMedia to create a social experience that is accessible across all desktop and mobile devices.

= Transcoder Features =
1. **Works with ANY WordPress website** - Transcoder plugs into your current website seamlessly, instantly improving user audio/video experience.
2. **rtMedia integration** - Works perfectly with our own [rtMedia](https://rtmedia.io/?utm_source=readme&utm_medium=plugin&utm_campaign=transcoder), for a complete social media platform.
3. **Thumbnail generation** - Automatically generate up to 10 thumbnails for every video, from which your users can choose one.
4. **[rt_media] shortcode** - Use our shortcode to display transcoded audio/video file on any post or page. For example, [rt_media attachment_id=xx] the attachment_id parameter specifies the file to be displayed.

= Privacy Warning =
In order for us to transcode your media files, we need to copy it over to our server.
After transcoding is completed, the media can reside on our server for a maximum of 24 hours, before it is permanently and irreversibly removed by a Cron job.

= Future Roadmap =
* Additional output formats for video- ogg, webm
* Downsampling capabilities for output video resolution
* RESTful API
